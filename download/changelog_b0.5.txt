Features and Fixing
Gameplay
    AI and Player accuracy calculations rebuilt for clarity and ease-of-balancing.
        Each Mech has an accuracy profile from the following list
            Sniper - low shot deviation, long convergence time
            Marksman - slightly below average deviation, low convergence time
                                    Skirmisher - average deviation, average convergence
                                    Low Tech   - above average deviation, slow convergence
            Primitive     - the worst
        Radar mode, Movement, and upgrade modules affect these stats.
    Weapons once again have shot deviation
        See game stats for exact numbers
    Zoom functionality is back in and very smooth.
        Radar refactored:
            Universal cylinder around player with radius equal to mech’s radar range.
